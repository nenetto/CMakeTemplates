CMakeSuperBuildTemplate\r\n\r\nCMakeProject configures executables, dynamic library or static library using CMake and creates the configuration folder structure for developing. On the other hand, CMakeSuperBuildTemplate is a template for a SuperBuild configuration folder structure. With minimal changes on the CMakeLists.txt files and adding your code files, configuration structure will be ready for your development, taking care of internal and external dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Tutorial\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at the [wiki](https://github.com/nenetto/CMakeTemplates/wiki) about the tool and how to use it.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was written by @nenetto\r\nThis project uses [CMakeAll](https://github.com/auneri/CMakeAll).\r\nSpecial thanks to @auneri for his valuable help and teaching skills.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with CMakeTemplates?
