# CMakeTemplates

### CMakeTemplates

The repository contain two folders:

1. CMakeProject
2. CMakeSuperBuildTemplate

CMakeProject configures executables, dynamic library or static library using CMake and creates the configuration folder structure for developing. On the other hand, CMakeSuperBuildTemplate is a template for a SuperBuild configuration folder structure. With minimal changes on the CMakeLists.txt files and adding your code files, configuration structure will be ready for your development, taking care of internal and external dependencies.
